For companies at early stage of their lifecycle, or those going through reorganization - our company offers a setup of DevOps processes from scratch.

We will assign a dedicated team of DevOps engineers to work together with your development and product teams. They will take complete ownership over all-things-DevOps.
This will include the following:
1. Choosing branching and release strategy: we'll consult with your product manager and technical leadership in order to minimize your Time-to-Market, while keeping things easy for developers.
2. CI/CD setup: we'll make sure that no code will go into production broken, unchecked, insecure, or even badly formatted. Oh, and no manual actions.
3. Infrastructure implemntation: using latest best-practices and leveraging Infrastructure-as-Code tools, we'll describe a secure and highly available infra in cloud, leaving you in full posession of all the artifacts. Even if you decide to stop working with us - you'll have a possibility to fire up new environment with a simple `make` command
4. Monitoring configuration: DevOps team will set the right tools in place, giving you a full transparency over your system. What, where, when, and why things happen - all in a unified dashboard. With alerting.
5. SRE processes: We will define all processes, related to keeping the lights on at all times: define SLAs with business, define internal SLIs and SLOs, describe incident playbooks and post-mortems, outline on-call and escalation processes, write automated incidents response scripts.
6. Ongoing support: helping development team to embrace best practices, arranging workshops on different parts of stack, participating in technical calls with your customers.
