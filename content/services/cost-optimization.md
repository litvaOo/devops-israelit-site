FinOps is hard and painful, and AWS can eat away a huge chunk of the already tight budget.

For projects of any size, we propose our services in cloud cost management.

A dedicated engineer from our team will enumerate all used resources and provide you with an exausting list of items. You'll get complete visibility on how much all environments, customers, teams and departments are spending.

From here, we'll propose a way to cut those costs down: what can be safely removed, what can be easily reimplemented, what can be reserved strategically, and what external tools might prove beneficial.

Depending on state of affairs, you can expect from 20% up to 80% of savings on infrastructure.
